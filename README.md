# STAT 540 - Intro-assignment

## Introduction

My name is **Ekpereka Amutaigwe**. I am a Master's student in the Genome Science and 
Technology program. I'm a Nigerian female :nigeria:. I love reading :book: and singing :musical_note:.
My LinkedIn profile can be found in this link-[Ekpereka Amutaigwe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ekpereka-amutaigwe-1408b4128/)

### MSc Thesis project

For my thesis, I'm studying the genome-wide occupancy of the Hippo pathway transcription
factor - TEAD2 and its interactions with other transcription factors and histone
modifications, and how these interactions influence gene expression in embryonic hepatoblasts using the mouse model.

### What I hope to learn in the course

As RNA-Seq analysis is a major part of this course, I hope to learn how to analyze gene expression data and also carry out a differential gene expression analysis project. The statistical analysis aspect of the course is also very relevant to my project. And I hope to improve my knowledge of the R Language.

### Purpose of the repository

This repository contains info on the intro-assignment for STAT 540 which has the following parts:

1. Create a README in your repo
2. Data inspection with R
3. Data visualization
4. Mechanics

##### Gratitude!

I am grateful to the teaching team for doing a good job. The course is interesting and the delivery is fantastic!
